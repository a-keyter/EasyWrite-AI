0,JOJJxz,pdqNYZ,2023-06-27 19:24:29,Remote,Senior Leadership Team,Problem solving can be slow at work because all of our ideas get passed up the chain and it can be weeks before we hear back from other members of the team.,4,"More autonomy and ability to make agile decisions. I'd like to be able to try out new solutions in contained environments and then present my findings to the team, rather than having to get a green light from my boss at every turn.",I regularly feel ignored or misunderstood. My manager doesn't invite me to meetings that directly affect the clients I work with.,2,"I'd like to have more regular meetings with senior leaders where I can openly share my work, rather than having my manager take credit for everything I do.",It feels very cliquey. My manager won't interact with me outside of work tasks and my colleagues organise events which I don't get invited too.,2,I'd like more regular staff social events and the opportunity to get to know members from other teams.,I think we should be more open about negotiating effectively as a team and with our clients.,4,More training and opportunities to shadow / learn from experienced members of the team.,Things only seem to get picked up on when we're snowed under. I don't get much feedback from my manager about my performance unless I'm struggling or I've done something wrong. ,3,I'd like to be recognised and rewarded for the times when my work is going well. This could be something simple like a shout out on slack or just a quick mention in our fortnightly meetings,Leadership can be hard to communicate with and it doesn't always feel like I have an influence in the decision making process. ,3,I think staff decisions should be made more democratic and we should have more opportunities to feed into the development of the organisation's strategic priorities.,Very limited provisions - the workplace councilling service once told me that I needed specialist support that they couldn't provide for me.,3,I think there should be more open communication about wellbeing and space in the day for us to take breaks. Maybe we could have a wellbeing catch up with a wellbeing champion in each office or something?,I'd like to be more involved with the team on planning and delivering new projects.
1,RDJJ6Q,vr6a5d,2023-06-27 19:25:04,Remote,Team Member,"Pretty good - we discuss ideas and experiences as a team and brainstorm possible solutions together. Decisions aren't always unanimous, but everyone always at least understands why they've been made.",8,They're normally quite quick discussions. I would prefer to have some time to think about the problems in more detail and evaluate the different options.,"Communication in the team I work in is really strong. We use messages on Teams primarily, and email if it's a longer message or something we'd need to be able to trace back. 
We call each other frequently when we feel something would be easier discussing 'in person' and have three whole-team checkins each week so everyone is updated on everything they need.",9,My manager often takes a while to respond to Teams messages,"The relationships are very relaxed, which I like. We don't see each other in real life very often so it's important that we make an effort to maintain strong virtual relationships as a team.",10,I don't think they could.,not applicable,5,not applicable,"Approaches to performance management are fairly relaxed. We have 1-to-1s with our line manager once every 3-6 months, but these are more about what we're enjoying or struggling with work. We don't have individual KPIs as we're mostly working towards collective goals. My manager is very good at giving feedback as and when issues arise.",6,Updates on team KPIs aren't shared very often and I think more 'hard deadlines' would help me keep track of my progress.,"Very good - my line manager is really open and honest with us as a team. Decisions on every day work can be made individually and as a team when the decision affects all of us. My manager always shares decisions with us that have been made higher up, as well as the reasons for them.",10,not applicable,"Good, though I don't use many of them. Not many of them feel particularly relevant to me. We have 'no meeting Fridays' which doesn't really apply to my role as I don't have internal meetings. We have a bi-annual stock-take day which I'm finding really beneficial. I know there are wellbeing groups, but they're not very active so it doesn't feel like there's that much to get involved in. I feel comfortable talking to my manager about any personal issues affecting me at work.",6,"I'm not sure it could, I've just never used any of the options available to me. I think I'd like a quarterly stock-take day, and maybe for more effort to be put into making the wellbeing groups more active.",
